# Being Well with enterprise Value
### by using film `Asha`, coach `aiSaki`, portfolios for pension funds `pf4pf`, and other asset offerings


In 2012-Feb, the [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) committed to a wealth ecosystem that harmonized alignment of fund-management fees with extraordinary growth and [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value). By 2015 for a national pension-fund regulator, this [report](http://pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=682) recommended a variable fee on Performance as part of an "economically-viable incentive structure, without compromising low cost" in a phased transition to a Prudent-Investor regime. Back in 2012-Feb, the author committed to raised Well Being of a million people. And by 2015, [India Newborn Action Plan](http://nhm.gov.in/india-newborn-action-plan.html) was "Indiaâ€™s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP)." The author was *one* cause in the matter, with no authority, given mandate, or precedent; such is a power available to all human beings. The author wishes that everyone be aware of and exercise this power.

You and society are invited to the next level of Well Being and enterprise Value by also using offerings such as film `Asha` and coach `aiSaki` or evolving their [software repositories](https://github.com/yadevinit):

* Short film [Asha: the Light of Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ldaTXYRks) invites you and society to the next level of newborn longevity. It sets a background for generating leadership anywhere.

* [Coach aiSaki](https://yadevinit.shinyapps.io/aiSaki/) gets you to Declare a Breakdown in any area of life and create a future that matters. You can use this intelligent-machine coach from a browser on your mobile device or computer. Regarding its technology: presently, this app is hosted using the secure [shinyapps.io by RStudio](http://www.shinyapps.io/); with a future voice interface, the following voice persona could be integrated with this app:
``` {r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # beware: instead of updating HTML or MD file directly, update this RMD file. Then for ease,
  # use RStudio to Pull from GitHub repository, change the RMD, run Knit to HTML, confirm diffs
  # are ok, Commit changed files after Staging, Push to GitHub repository, and finally, confirm
  # this README shows up and offers links as wanted.
  # From RStudio, Pull, Push, etc., can be done from its Git version control menu.

  # beware: turned off messages such as Warning: package 'shiny' was built under R version 3.4.4
  # in RStudio, create new repository project from Github. Then 'Knit to HTML' after turning on
  # Advanced setting 'Keep Markdown files' on the .Rmd. Then change YAML to the following:
  #   html_document:
  #     keep_md: yes
  # instead of the following:
  # output: 
  #   github_document
  # ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content
  # ref: http://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html

  # add a voice persona to introduce coach *aiSaki* using the following:
  library(shiny)
  tags$audio(src = "persona-JagjitSingh.mp3", type = "audio/mp3", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)

  # ![](URL) syntax can be used for linking to film Asha video outside this code chunk. alt:
  # tags$video(src = "rabbit320.mp4", type = "video/mp4", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)
    # height, width can be set too as parameters
  # <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE"
  #   target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
  #   alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
  # Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
  # [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)]
  #   (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
