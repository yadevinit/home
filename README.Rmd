# Being Well with enterprise Value
### by using film `Asha`, coach `aiSaki`, and other asset offerings


In 2012-Feb, the [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) committed to a wealth ecosystem that harmonized alignment of fund-management fees with extraordinary growth and [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value). By 2015, this [report](http://pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=682) happened for a national pension-fund regulator. Back in 2012-Feb, the author committed to raised Well Being of a million people. And by 2015, [India Newborn Action Plan](http://nhm.gov.in/india-newborn-action-plan.html) was "India’s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP)." The author was *one* cause in the matter, with no authority, given mandate, or precedent; such is a power available to all human beings. The author wishes that everyone be aware of and exercise this power.

You and society are invited to the next level of Well Being and enterprise Value by also using offerings such as film `Asha` and coach `aiSaki`:

* Short film [Asha: the Light of Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ldaTXYRks) invites you and society to the next level of newborn longevity. It sets a background for generating leadership anywhere. Use it, share it, and participate in co-creating a new realm of society Being Well.

* [Coach aiSaki](https://yadevinit.shinyapps.io/aiSaki/) gets you to Declare a Breakdown in any area of life and create a future that matters. You can use this intelligent-machine coach from a browser on your mobile device or computer. Regarding what's next with `aiSaki` on the technology front:

    + You can publicly evolve its software at its [source-code repository](https://github.com/yadevinit/aiSaki) with this [license](./LICENSE).

    + Presently, this app is hosted using the secure [shinyapps.io by RStudio](http://www.shinyapps.io/). A [JupyterLab Notebook architecture](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html) is being considered to support its future evolution, including unrestricted use of Python (and other language) modules from GitHub. Making it into an [R](http://r-project.org/) package and consistent with [OpenCPU](https://www.opencpu.org/) are expected to ease and attract community interfaces and participation.

    + As part of its voice interface, the following voice persona can be integrated with this app:
``` {r warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
  # beware: turned off messages such as Warning: package 'shiny' was built under R version 3.4.4
  # in RStudio, create new repository project from Github. Then 'Knit to HTML' after turning on
  # Advanced setting 'Keep Markdown files' on the .Rmd. Then change YAML to the following:
  #   html_document:
  #     keep_md: yes
  # instead of the following:
  # output: 
  #   github_document
  # ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content
  # ref: http://happygitwithr.com/rmd-test-drive.html

  # add a voice persona to introduce coach *aiSaki* using the following:
  library(shiny)
  tags$audio(src = "persona-JagjitSingh.mp3", type = "audio/mp3", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)

  # ![](URL) syntax can be used for linking to film Asha video outside this code chunk. alt:
  # tags$video(src = "rabbit320.mp4", type = "video/mp4", autoplay = NA, controls = NA)
    # height, width can be set too as parameters
  # <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE"
  #   target="_blank"><img src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg"
  #   alt="IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE" width="240" height="180" border="10" /></a>
  # Or, in pure Markdown, but losing the image sizing and border:
  # [![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)]
  #   (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE)
