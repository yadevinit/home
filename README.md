# Being Well with enterprise Value
### by using film `Asha`, coach `aiSaki`, portfolios for pension funds `pf4pf`, and other asset offerings


In 2012-Feb, the [author](mailto:yadevinit@gmail.com) committed to a wealth ecosystem that harmonized alignment of fund-management fees with extraordinary growth and [Net Present Value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value). By 2015 for a national pension-fund regulator, this [report](http://pfrda.org.in/myauth/admin/showimg.cshtml?ID=682) recommended a variable fee on Performance as part of an "economically-viable incentive structure, without compromising low cost" in a phased transition to a Prudent-Investor regime. Back in 2012-Feb, the author committed to raised Well Being of a million people. And by 2014, [India Newborn Action Plan](https://nhm.gov.in/index4.php?lang=1&level=0&linkid=153&lid=174) was "Indiaâ€™s committed response to the Global Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP)." The author was *one* cause in the matter, with no authority, given mandate, or precedent; such is a power available to all human beings. The author wishes that everyone be aware of and exercise this power.

You and society are invited to the next level of Well Being and enterprise Value by also using the following asset offerings or evolving their [software repositories](https://github.com/yadevinit):

* Short film [Asha: the Light of Hope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97ldaTXYRks) invites you and society to the next level of newborn longevity. It sets a background for generating leadership anywhere.

* Coach [aiSaki](https://yadevinit.shinyapps.io/aiSaki/) gets you to Declare a Breakdown in any area of life and create a future that matters. You can use this intelligent-machine coach from a browser on your mobile device or computer. Regarding its technology: presently, this app is hosted using the secure [shinyapps.io by RStudio](http://www.shinyapps.io/); with a future voice interface, the following voice persona could be integrated with this app:
